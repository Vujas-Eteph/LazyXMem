## TL;DR
- **Goals:** We aim to enhance long-term object tracking by prioritizing robustness over pure accuracy. Our approach leverages on-the-fly user corrections to improve performance while minimizing user workload. To evaluate this, we introduce **lazy video object segmentation** (**ziVOS**), where an object is segmented in a video with only one user interaction round (in contrast to interactive VOS), and where corrections are provided on-the-fly, *i.e,* while the method is segmenting the video sequence.
- **Motivations:** Lazy-XMem gauges prediction confidence in "real-time" (via Shannon Entropy) to determine when to use pseudo-corrections or request user input, with [SAM-HQ](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq) aiding the process. Pseudo-corrections reduce the need for user involvement by allowing self-correction.
- **Results:** Initial results are promising, showing performance and robustness gains through pseudo-corrections alone, and significant improvement with minimal user annotation (1.05% of the dataset).
